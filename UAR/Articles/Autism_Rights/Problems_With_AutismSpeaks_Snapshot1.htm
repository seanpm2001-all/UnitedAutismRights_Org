<H2 lang="en">Problems with AutismSpeaks (organization) - UAR/Autism_Rights</H2>
<p lang="en">AutismSpeaks is a major threat to the progress of people with Autism. Despite being the most popular advocacy group, AutismSpeaks is riddled with problems, and is a clear and present danger. In fact, they are the reason why I started this organization for Autistic rights. I couldn't stand seeing any more of their TV ads without trying to do something about it.</p>
<p lang="en">AutismSpeaks has a long history of saying things that belittle people with Autism, or undermine the progress of people with Autism. Notable controveries include:</p>
<p lang="en">* Labeling Autism as a disease (it is actually a disorder, not a contagion) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110707191354/http://autismresearchcentre.com/docs/papers/2008_BC_Review_of_Living_Googles.pdf">[1]</a>
</article>
<p lang="en">[excerpt from Wikipedia, to be edited] In January 2008, an autistic blogger, upset with the portrayal of autism at Autism Speaks's website, "Getting the Word Out",[52] created a critical parody website titled "Getting the Truth Out".[53] It was later taken down in response to legal demands from Autism Speaks to stop using its name and logo without permission. Autism Speaks said the spoof could confuse people looking for information about autism. New parody sites were later launched by Gareth Nelson, founder of the autism rights group Aspies for Freedom</p><!-- I currently don't know how to word this better !-->
<p lang="en">* AutismSpeaks is a major actor in the belief that vaccines cause Autism, leading to increased vaccine hesistancy. This is a danger to public health. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126%2Fscience.325_135a">[2]</a></p>
<p lang="en">* AutismSpeaks has used dangerous rhetoric about Autism, downplaying and belittling it in dangerous ways, such as the "common though for parents" that having someone with Autism is not something you can live with and that you should drive off a bridge and commit murder-suicide <a href="https://nytimes.com/2007/01/21/nyregion/nyregionspecial2/21lifilm.html">[3]</a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080523223522/http://wiretapmag.org/education/38631">[4]</a></p>
<p lang="en"><b>This list is a stub. You can help UAR by <i>expanding it</i></b></p>
<p lang="en">These are just some of the common things AutismSpeaks has done to hinder the movement for Autism Awareness.</p>

<p lang="en">The puzzle piece is an outdated symbol for Autism, from a 2018 study, it evokes a bad reaction <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6085079/">[1A]</a></p>
